<div class="aboutmediv">
  <p> I am a visual specialist in Banana Republic who was deadset on entering the medical field. However, upon taking a job as a technical recruiter, it made me realize my love for technology.</p>
  <p>My manager at SIRC allowed me to play with designing a template website for their sister company SILLC and it opened up a whole new set of doors for me to explore. I fell in love with the concept of web development. As I was looking to re-enter the college life, General Assembly started popping up in my social media feeds and after communicating with GA alumnis I knew it was meant to be.</p>
  <p>Combining my experience as a visual specialist, I love creating contents that are unique yet appealing to the users.</p>
